# Hi, I’m John Njuguna 👋 @JohnM_77

- 🧭 Based in Nairobi — builder, tinkerer, and lifelong learner.  
- 💼 Background: software engineer with open-source contributions and three years building product prototypes and developer tools.  
- 🛠️ Tech interests: AI, ML, cloud, blockchain, DePIN, and developer APIs.  
- 💻 Languages & tools (currently): C, Python, Shell scripting, Django, Pandas, Solidity (prototyping), Node.js.  
- 🌱 Learning now: full-stack web development, systems design, secure smart contracts, and production-grade infra (Kubernetes / Terraform).  
- 🚀 Projects I’ve shipped / worked on:
  - **CoinByte** — programmable stablecoin rails (whitepaper, CLI prototype, API mock).  
  - **Shield** — prototype for an autonomous security agent (voice + AI).  
  - **BYTE** — an AI research-assistant concept and multi-model tooling experiments.  
  - **CargoMate** — earlier supply-chain prototype (learning experience that helped shape my product focus).  
- 🤝 I’m open to: collaboration on APIs, payments, DePIN, and AI tooling. I’m especially interested in devs or founders who want to build pragmatic, early-stage systems that ship and iterate quickly.
